Welcome to the repository for the project "Computational Analysis of Mythologies Using Machine Learning." This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to analyze mythological texts from Hindu, Norse, and Greek traditions. The primary goal is to uncover and compare themes, sentiments, and narrative structures within these ancient narratives.

The project involves several key components, including data preparation, thematic clustering with K-Means, supervised learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest for thematic prediction, and sentiment analysis using TextBlob. Statistical methods, such as the Chi-square test, are employed to assess the significance of thematic distributions across different mythologies.

This repository contains all the necessary scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization. The main scripts include data preparation, tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, K-Means clustering, supervised learning models, statistical analysis, and sentiment analysis.

Feel free to explore the code and use it for further studies or practical applications. For more details, please refer to the individual script files and the accompanying documentation.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
